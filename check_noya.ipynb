During this 12 hours, if the profit of noya goes lower than the profit amount at the end of step 1, anyone can call the function 'checkIfTVLHasDroped' and the fees that were recorded in the step 1 will be put to 0. To get the fees again, the manager has to do the first step again and wait for 12 hours. If the profit doesn’t drop within 12 hours, it means that there was no manipulation. Then it can call 'collectPerformanceFees' function of the accountingManager and get the performance fee. \\n   - Possible Var Names from ChatGPT: ['pendingPerformanceFee', 'accumulatedFeeReserve', 'managerProfitShare'] \\n   - Expression:  0 \\n'\\n\\n   &ensp;**Is the fee found**\\n '   No'\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_name**\\n '   performanceFee'\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_exp**\\n '   performanceFee = '\\n\\n   &ensp;**isEq**\\n '   Eq(getProfit(), 0)'\\n\\n\\n## hidden_fee_function\\n\\n### collectManagementFees\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '(0, 0), \\n (2.73972602739726e-8*managementFee*(-currentFeeShares + totalShares), 10)'\\n\\n\\n## hidden_fee_var\\n\\n### FEE_PRECISION\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '1e6'\\n\\n### WITHDRAWAL_MAX_FEE\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '5e4'\\n\\n### MANAGEMENT_MAX_FEE\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '5e5'\\n\\n### PERFORMANCE_MAX_FEE\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '1e5'\\n\\n### withdrawFeeReceiver\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '_withdrawFeeReceiver'\\n\\n### performanceFeeReceiver\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '_performanceFeeReceiver'\\n\\n### managementFeeReceiver\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '_managementFeeReceiver'\\n\\n### withdrawFee\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '_withdrawFee'\\n\\n### performanceFee\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '_performanceFee'\\n\\n### withdrawFeeAmount\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '0'\\n\\n### feeAmount\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '1.0e-6*baseTokenAmount*withdrawFee'\\n\\n### storedProfitForFee\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '0, \\n -totalAWFDeposit - totalDepositedAmount + totalWithdrawnAmount + balanceOf(address(this)) + getTVL(0, registry, address(baseToken))'\\n\\n### preformanceFeeSharesWaitingForDistribution\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n 'previewDeposit(1.0e-6*performanceFee*(storedProfitForFee - totalProfitCalculated)), \\n 0, \\n 0'\\n\\n### lastFeeDistributionTime\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n 'timestamp'\\n\\n### currentFeeShares\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n 'preformanceFeeSharesWaitingForDistribution + balanceOf(managementFeeReceiver) + balanceOf(performanceFeeReceiver)'\\n\\n### managementFeeAmount\\n\\n  &ensp;** Possible Values **:\\n '2.73972602739726e-8*managementFee*(-currentFeeShares + totalShares)'\\n\\n\\n\""
