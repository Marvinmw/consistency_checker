No need for complex smart contract interactions like staking, liquidity providing or yield farming.\\n     \\n   - Possible Var Names from ChatGPT: ['reflectionFee', 'hodlReward', 'communityReward'] \\n   - Expression:  0.02 \\n\\n\\n   &ensp;**Is the fee found**\\n    Yes\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_name**\\n    reflectionFee\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_exp**\\n    reflectionFee = 2\\n\\n   &ensp;**isEq**\\n    True\\n\\n### Item v1\\n\\n   &ensp;**info**\\n   &emsp; \\n- Description: \\n    Liquidity Pool (1%)\\n    What is a liquidity Pool?\\n    A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract making a token tradable on decentralized exchanges. \\n    A liquidity pool consists of two different tokens both representing a certain value which combined are known as 'the liquidity'. Most of the time a liquidity pool is created with 50% of a certain token on one side and 50% of the other token on the other side.\\n    When liquidity is provided to a liquidity pool, people receive liquidity pool tokens which serve as their evidence in the blockchain proving that they provided this liquidity.\\n     \\n   - Possible Var Names from ChatGPT: ['liquidityPoolFee', 'liquidityCharge', 'liquidityFeePercentage'] \\n   - Expression:  0.01 \\n\\n\\n   &ensp;**Is the fee found**\\n    No\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_name**\\n    liquidityFee\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_exp**\\n    liquidityFee = 2\\n\\n   &ensp;**isEq**\\n    False\\n\\n### Item v2\\n\\n   &ensp;**info**\\n   &emsp; \\n- Description: \\n    threshold for the HFT liquidity pool\\n    We anticipated on that by implementing a threshold of 2200 BNB for the HFT liquidity pool as we determined this to be the perfect balance between enough liquidity and tradable volatility. \\n    Once the threshold of 2200 BNB is met, the part of the network fee which goes to the liquidity pool will flow to the marketing treasury.\\n     \\n   - Possible Var Names from ChatGPT: ['hftLiquidityPoolThreshold', 'liquidityThreshold', 'bnbThreshold'] \\n   - Expression:  2200 \\n\\n\\n   &ensp;**Is the fee found**\\n    No\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_name**\\n    previousLiquidityFee\\n\\n   &ensp;**matched_var_exp**\\n    previousLiquidityFee = liquidityFee\\n\\n   &ensp;**isEq**\\n    Eq(liquidityFee, 2200000000000000000000)\\n\\n### Item v3\\n\\n   &ensp;**info**\\n   &emsp; \\n- Description: \\n    Foundation (3%)\\n    What is the foundation?\\n    The foundation is the entity making sure all operations on the central side of the Hodl Finance ecosystem run smoothly.
