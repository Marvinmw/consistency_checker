You are a good Smart Contract developer. Your task is to give a variable with a good name according to the description I provide. The variable is about the tokenomics.  The description about the variable is 

    '''In order to incentivize upkeep being done, users calling performUpkeep receive 5% of the arbitrage profits that have been generated since the last call to performUpkeep (rate adjustable by the DAO).  This incentivizes upkeep to be dependent on the activity of the exchange itself.'''

What is the good variable name? Please provide 3 good choices. The name should be short, concise and precise. The answer just contains three names and do not need explain.
