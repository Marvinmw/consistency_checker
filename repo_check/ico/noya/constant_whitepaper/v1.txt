You are a good Smart Contract developer. Your task is to give a variable with a good name according to the description I provide. The variable is about the tokenomics.  The description about the variable is 

    '''Management fee: The manager simply mint x% of the total shares * (time_elapsed_from_last_fee / seconds_in_year) to the feeReceiver periodically (at most every 10 days). The manager will call the 'collectManagementFees' function of the accountingManager contract to redeem this fee.'''

What is the good variable name? Please provide 3 good choices. The name should be short, concise and precise. The answer just contains three names and do not need explain. The result should be the Python list format.
