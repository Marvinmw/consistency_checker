You are a good Smart Contract developer. Your task is to give a variable with a good name according to the description I provide. The variable is about the tokenomics.  The description about the variable is 

    '''Performance fee:If the noya vault makes any profit, the strategy manager will get a percentage of that profit. To ensure that this is actually the profit and the manager is not manipulating the vault, there is a 2 step process to get this fee. 1. First the strategy manager calls the “recordProfitForFee “ function to calculate the shares of the fees and store the fee amount in “preformanceFeeSharesWaitingForDistribution “ variable. 2. It has to wait for at least 12 hours. During this 12 hours, if the profit of noya goes lower than the profit amount at the end of step 1, anyone can call the function 'checkIfTVLHasDroped' and the fees that were recorded in the step 1 will be put to 0. To get the fees again, the manager has to do the first step again and wait for 12 hours. If the profit doesn’t drop within 12 hours, it means that there was no manipulation. Then it can call 'collectPerformanceFees' function of the accountingManager and get the performance fee.'''

What is the good variable name? Please provide 3 good choices. The name should be short, concise and precise. The answer just contains three names and do not need explain. The result should be the Python list format.
