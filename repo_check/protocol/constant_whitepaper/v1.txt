    What is a liquidity Pool?
    A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract making a token tradable on decentralized exchanges. 
    A liquidity pool consists of two different tokens both representing a certain value which combined are known as 'the liquidity'. Most of the time a liquidity pool is created with 50% of a certain token on one side and 50% of the other token on the other side.
    When liquidity is provided to a liquidity pool, people receive liquidity pool tokens which serve as their evidence in the blockchain proving that they provided this liquidity.
