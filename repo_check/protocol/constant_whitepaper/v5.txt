You are a good Smart Contract developer. Your task is to give a variable with a good name according to the description I provide. The variable is about the charge fee.  The description about the variable is 

    '''
    Mystery challenge (1%)
    Be extraordinary if you want to stand out
    We can not say much about the mystery challenge yet, but it will be something else. Something that has never been done in the crypto domain before.
    '''

What is the good variable name? Please provide 3 good choices. The name should be short, concise and precise. The answer just contains three names and do not need explain.
