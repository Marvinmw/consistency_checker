Reflection (2%)
What is reflection?
Reflection, as many people know it, is often used by meme coins.
The Hodl Finance team sees reflection as an advanced smart contract mechanism to easily reward the community for holding on to HFT. No need for complex smart contract interactions like staking, liquidity providing or yield farming. Just hodl and you will be rewarded, how easy is that!?
Another important feature that reflection has is the fact that people are rewarded with tokens which are already circulating. This means no inflation but only deflation as your position in the maximum supply grows each time you are being reflected.
How do you benefit from it?
As described above, reflection is used to reward the dedicated hodlers of the Hodl Finance community. You benefit from it by just holding HFT in your web3 wallet and letting the smart contract calculations do the rest. This makes sure that everyone in the Hodl Finance ecosystem is evenly rewarded for their commitment.
How are reflection rewards calculated?
People with different amounts of HFT will also receive different amounts of rewards. It does not mean that the smart contract likes one person more than the other, it just means that the reflection is being calculated by weight.
Below an example:


Liquidity Pool (1%)
What is a liquidity Pool?
A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract making a token tradable on decentralized exchanges. 
A liquidity pool consists of two different tokens both representing a certain value which combined are known as 'the liquidity'. Most of the time a liquidity pool is created with 50% of a certain token on one side and 50% of the other token on the other side.
When liquidity is provided to a liquidity pool, people receive liquidity pool tokens which serve as their evidence in the blockchain proving that they provided this liquidity.
How is liquidity provided for HFT?
As in all the things we do, we like to do it a bit differently, and by doing so we also made liquidity providing for HFT easier and more safe. Because next to the automated reflection that our hodlers get, we also automated the process of adding liquidity to the liquidity pool without having to rely on third parties.
At the start of the Hodl Finance ecosystem, a Token Generation Event (TGE) occurred. 10% of the maximum supply of HFT was entered into the liquidity pool together with a certain BNB amount which was equal to $150,000. The price of HFT was set at $0.00000714 and we started with a liquidity pool of $300,000 in total.
Now, with every person making a smart contract interaction, a portion is automatically divided into 50% HFT and 50% BNB to be entered into the liquidity pool. After the smart contract provides the liquidity it receives liquidity pool tokens which will be sent to the burn address. This means that all liquidity going in the liquidity pool through the Hodl Finance smart contract is locked forever!
What did we notice?
When looking at other projects which also provide automatic liquidity through the smart contract, we noticed something.
The more liquidity was added to a liquidity pool, the more stable the price became. 

threshold for the HFT liquidity pool
We anticipated on that by implementing a threshold of 2200 BNB for the HFT liquidity pool as we determined this to be the perfect balance between enough liquidity and tradable volatility. 
Once the threshold of 2200 BNB is met, the part of the network fee which goes to the liquidity pool will flow to the marketing treasury. Since the crypto domain is rapidly evolving and marketing is a big part of keeping your project in the headlines, we opted for this.

Foundation (3%)
What is the foundation?
The foundation is the entity making sure all operations on the central side of the Hodl Finance ecosystem run smoothly. It manages the manual conversions, buy-backs with profits, and last but certainly not least the Foundation Trading Algorithms (FTA), which serve as the core engine of the total ecosystem. 

How does the foundation work?
As with the reflection and with the liquidity pool, the foundation also automatically receives BNB from a part of the network fee that has been converted in the smart contract. Periodically this BNB will be manually converted to BTC, which combined represent the Inflow Base (IB) and increases the Total Value Locked (TVL) within the Foundation Trading Algorithms (FTA)
The higher the TVL grows the stronger the HFT token becomes. That is because Hodl Finance is not only supported by its own ecosystem but also by all other tokens/coins that are actively being traded on in the FTA. The FTA is designed in such a way that sustainable profits are being made, no big peaks and no big drops, just sustainable growth by always accumulating more of the fundamentally strongest tokens/coins in crypto.
Once the BTC value in the FTA outpaces the IB, a Surplus is performed which actually represents the profits that have been made for that week. The Surplus will then be converted to BNB so the buyback of HFT will occur, deflationary (!) All HFT that has been bought back will be put in the Treasury and used for future innovation voted on by the community.
Where can you verify all this?
The TVL, Treasury, Conversions, and the FTA live performance and monitoring can be found in the Hodl Finance . Also, each week the FTA trading result is communicated to the community through our social accounts.
Why do we show all of this online 24/7 and to be monitored by our community and public? Because: 
We are certain that transparancy is key;
It will strengthen our community, its collective intelligence and grow our already robust and future proof ecosystem.

Marketing treasury (3%)
What is the marketing treasury?
The marketing treasury has been implemented after proposal 001 was approved by the community. It will be used for all marketing related actions so that the word of Hodl Finance will be spread. Same as for Reflection and Foundation, the smart contracts automatically send 3 percent out of the 10 percent Network fee to the Marketing treasury.
Hodl Finance is an ecosystem created for constant innovation which means new projects being introduced constantly. If those projects are marketed in the right way, it will funnel community and volume right back to Hodl Finance since the incubated projects and Hodl Finance are intertwined.
Of course, we will also invest in marketing for Hodl Finance itself, but in that case it will be to encourage pioneers to bring their innovative ideas to our ecosystem.
What was the reason behind the marketing treasury?
Hodl Finance thrives by the people interacting with the smart contract. It means that selling, buying and sending the HFT token will benefit the whole ecosystem, marketing will enhance this.
Initially, a large part of the network fee went to the Foundation Trading Algorithms, but we noticed that the amount flowing there was continually dropping. It was because the interest of people was difficult to maintain with minimal marketing efforts in a market going downwards. That was when we initiated the idea to implement the marketing treasury earlier than planned.
It is a simple calculation because if the marketing treasury generates enough attention and volume to make up for the deduction of network fee going to the Foundation, we will end up with a bigger community, more attention for incubated projects and an equal, or possibly even larger amount going to the Foundation.
The Marketing of Hodl Finance will be funded out of the Marketing treasury but much more importantly: We will encourage pioneers with it to propose innovative ideas so that the Hodl Finance ecosystem will be ever growing.

Mystery challenge (1%)
Be extraordinary if you want to stand out
We can not say much about the mystery challenge yet, but it will be something else. Something that has never been done in the crypto domain before.
Hodl Finance is maturing and professionalizing faster every day, but because of that we do not want to lose sight of the fun and challenging side of crypto. That is why the mystery challenge was introduced.
It will be something for the community, and especially for the smart and dedicated members!
